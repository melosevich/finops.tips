## What It Is
burst capacity overprovisioning spend is governed by three levers: utilization profile, pricing model (on-demand vs commitment), and architecture efficiency (duration, memory/compute, and data movement).

## Why It Matters
Uncoordinated pricing and architecture decisions increase waste risk. Durable FinOps gains come from combining engineering changes with the right commercial commitment.

## How to Act
1. Break service cost into utilization, commitment, and architecture components and quantify variance against last month.
2. Choose one procurement move (coverage adjustment) and one engineering move (efficiency reduction) that can be shipped this sprint.
3. Validate realized savings with before/after unit economics and retire changes that fail to beat forecast.

## Example
If burst capacity overprovisioning shows rising idle headroom and weak commitment utilization, tighten autoscaling floors, rebalance commitments, and remove underused capacity pools to recover margin without service risk.
